# Soil Sensor RS485 Service Configuration
# Configuration for DFRobot RS485 4-in-1 Soil Sensors

# RS485 serial port configuration
rs485:
  port: /dev/serial0  # GPIO UART (or /dev/ttyUSB0 for USB adapter)
  baudrate: 9600      # Modbus RTU baudrate
  timeout: 1.0        # Serial read timeout in seconds

# Polling configuration
polling:
  interval_seconds: 5  # Polling interval in seconds

# Sensor configurations
# Each sensor must have a unique Modbus slave ID
sensors:
  - modbus_id: 1                    # Modbus slave ID (must be unique per sensor)
    name: "soil_sensor_front_bed"    # Base name for sensor (snake_case)
    bed_name: "Front Bed"           # Bed name (maps to rack.name in database)
    room_name: "Flower Room"        # Room name

# To add more sensors, add additional entries to the sensors list:
#  - modbus_id: 2
#    name: "soil_sensor_back_bed"
#    bed_name: "Back Bed"
#    room_name: "Flower Room"
